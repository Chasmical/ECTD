## How to add items/traits? ##
You need to type 'description commands' in your custom character's description, like so:
```
++PlasmaSword
^^Strength=228
**BananaLover2
%%WerewolfLunge
^^Speed=-2
```
After saving the character, a text will appear in the description, describing the changes that were made:
```
[ITEM 'PlasmaSword' ADDED]
[STAT 'Strength' SET TO '228']
[TRAIT 'BananaLover2' ADDED]
[ABILITY 'WerewolfLunge' ADDED]
[STAT 'Speed' SET TO '-2']
```

See the [guide in Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2093706214) for more information.

## Tired of these annoying messages? ***(v2.8)*** ##

Here's how you can remove messages like "[Item 'Fud+50' added]":

Find a file called "ectd-nomessages.cfg" in BepInEx/config and write "true" in it. (if the file doesn't exist, start the game, the file will be created automatically, or create it yourself)

## New Mutators ##
You can select new mutators at Home Base!

* **[ECTD] No Limit Nuggets** - If enabled, allows you to get more than 99 nuggets. If disabled, does NOT reset the nuggets amount.

## Characters created using ECTD ##
When you're publishing your custom characters, you can use this template on Steam Workshop:
```
[b]This character requires ECTD to work!
